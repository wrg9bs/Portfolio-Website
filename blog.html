                <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
                <p>07.06.2021</p>
                <p>I will be making weekly blog posts about my coding journey, I am super excited! At the same time a little bit nervous about putting myself out there in the world! It is not an easy thing for an introvert. I guess thats what getting out of one's comfort zone entails. After all, what's the worst thing that can happen from this decision? I read the other day that, "action may not always bring happiness, but there is not happiness without action".</p>
                <br>
                <p>Perhaps the first thing to address is to answer why learn to code? Well, technology is around us and has become part of our daily lives really, and as such computer literacry has become as essential skill. I know computer literacy is not necessarily coding but artificial intelligence is becoming part of our lives. Google maps which I don't use daily knows my workplace and my home without me ever setting those on the application. My mobile phone knows which application I open when I wake up. Self-driving cars are already in our roads, robotic surgeries as well. So there has never been a better time to learn to code than now because we need to learn how to manage all this technology around us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The second reason is that web development is a booming industry with huge entrepreneurship opportunities. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has taught us remote working, and the web development is one industry where you can easily work from home. This actually has huge implications to things like climate change, if most people work from home, then traffic congestion is reduced, meaning, less CO2 emissions in our environment. You can take this further if you want... Working remotely is not for everyone though, the idea is appealing to me though.</p>
                <br>
                <p>That is a very good point to consider because there is a lot of information out there and lot of varying advise from different people. And everyone who has taught themselve to code, had a slightly different journey. You can literally spend days just searching where to start because there is just too much information out there, and computer programming is overwhelming especially when you are starting. There are numerous courses online with thousands of students and five-stars reviews. And then you have coding bootcamps which can cost thousands.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was going to teach myself everything by following a five month syllabus I got from Zero to Mastery. But then I thought that it is probably a good idea to join an online course where you can interact with fellow students, mentors and get a certificate upon completion. I think adding a certificate to your resume can help with increasing chances of getting a job upon finishing the course. By the way I made this decision half-way through the first month of going solo and I think it was the right call!</p>

                <h2>Javascript Hurdle</h2>
                <p>14.06.2021</p>
                <p>My last post was about why I have decided to start learning to code. It has now been over a month since I started and I have learnt a lot.<br>
                <p>As I had planned, the first month I dedicated it to learning HTML & CSS and I managed to build two static websites which I still haven’t uploaded online! I was planning on buying a domain name and hosting through Hostinger for the time being, so that after a year when I am more skilled i can utilise other options. One step at a time!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have officially started learning Javascript and I must say, it looks different from HTML & CSS. Now I am learning about data types, variables, functions, loops, conditionals and arrays. It felt overwhelming at the beginning and I just couldn’t connect the dots; in HTML & CSS I learnt about the different tags, styling and the like, Javascript is different and there are cool things you can do with it, like adding event listers, and changing HTML & CSS.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Now, ZTM academy is a great place to learn, but I feel like they seem to just go through things quickly and there are not enough exercises to help you become comfortable doing things on your own. I do know that one important part of coding is finding things and information on your own, so I get why maybe they don’t provide everything. <br>I came across The Odin Project, and what I liked about them is that they have learning objectives, and knowledge check at the end of each section where they have a list of questions of things you ought to know at the end of that particular section. It is great. They have Full Stack Ruby on Rails and Full Stack Javascript developer curriculums and I will definitely be learning from them and it is free! <br>Whilst on that, I also came across The App Academy which is free until you get hired, it has very high regards from those who have used it. My only issue is that once you get hired, you got to pay 15% of your salary (per month) to them for three years (tuition fee is capped at $31000). Maybe I am stingy, always looking for free stuff! That's actually not true because I have already paid for the ZTM course.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From there I also came across, Full Stack Open, which also has high regards, but it seems to be mostly for intermediate level learners. I will stick with ZTM and TOP, and once I have grasped enough, then will transition to Full Stack Open, it is free and you can get the certificate after completion of the required exercises. YouTube is also my best friend, for tutorials on building things.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>My first two weeks of learning Javascript I hit the wall, like so early? Yeah, I had this exercise which I managed to complete the 1st and 3rd parts but just couldn’t figure out how to do the 2nd part. It was about the DOM and I had just done a tutorial from Traversy Media and really felt like the exercise would be a breeze, nope! I didn’t want to check the solutions guide because I felt like other students managed to get the answer easily, so I also should be able to get it easily.<br>That morning I got up at 0230 to tackle the exercise, and around 0530 I went back into bed, but only slept for about half an hour and got back into the exercise, and I started blaming myself that I am not smart enough! At work, I went on stack overflow and boom someone had already posted the question two years ago! When I got home I got into the exercise with renewed enthusiasm, and before going to bed happened to watch two videos on YouTube, one from The Clever Programmer and another from Dev Ed. Their main message was that, stop watching tutorials! Build things on your own and put in the time, like when driving to work, listen to a coding podcast or book, like saturate your life with coding, that is if you want to make progress quickly. <br>I already listen to the CodeNewbie podcast almost daily, so that one is checked, I bought a book from Amazon called A Beginner’s Step-By-Step Coding Course, not the best resource since I now know most of the things, and they only have three languages, Scratch, Python, Javascript with HTML & CSS (I don’t know why they classify HTML & CSS as coding languages). After browsing through the book, I thought, maybe I should’ve just bought Zed Shaw’s Learn Javascript the Hard way!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anyway, the big lessons from this week is that, when you get stuck, please reach out to the community around you (if you have one), stack overflow and his big brother Google. <br>The second lesson is that, don’t get stuck in the tutorial loop, where you watch one tutorial after another, yet you cannot really build anything on your own. You learn by doing, so strive to create and build your own things, tutorials can be used for reference when you want to learn a new thing.</p>

                <h2>Tutorial Hell and Imposter Syndrome</h2>
                <p>26.06.2021</p>
                <p>This past week the above two words were the mantra. After the last post, I had said, don’t get stuck in tutorial hell, get up and build things on your own. Well, this week I made a conscious decision to get stuck in tutorial hell!<br>I feel like I was not getting enough from the lessons on ZTM, like I went to Coderbyte and Codingbat and I couldn’t solve the simplest exercises! That is why I said, I really need to get a thorough and good grasp of Javascript fundamentals. <br>Interestingly enough, there was one student on the dischord who asked whether FreeCodeCamp was any good because they were struggling to understand concepts from ZTM and felt that the course does not give enough exercises. I replied to their post and said, I thought I was the only one! I mentioned The Odin Project and even after revisiting their Javascript fundamentals, I couldn’t do their exercise. <br>Now this is where the imposter syndrome came in; I felt like I was so dumb to do anything really, like I was the only one who doesn’t know the simplest things. I think there’s lack of confidence as well.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>So, in order for me to get a thorough understanding of Javascript fundamentals, I decided, I will just embed myself in tutorial hell, and I found 3 videos on YouTube; one was a 12 hour coding bootcamp, the other two were 8 hour Javascript tutorials, one from FreeCodeCamp and the other from The Clever Programmer. I have done the first four hours of the coding bootcamp, and I stopped, it hit me again, start building things! You have learnt HMTL & CSS yet you still rely on a tutorial to build a simple static website. So I paused the tutorial so I can brush on my web building skills, and I am building my portfolio webpage, then two more webpage. This journey is turning out not as organised and structured as I had hoped it will be!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="undefined-blog" class="tabs">
                <h2>Undefined Syndrome</h2>
                <p>01.07.2021</p>
                <p>I got this other syndrome, I don’t know what it is called, like when you’re learning to code, the mind occasionally just goes blank and you spend hours and hours trying one thing after another and feel like you’re wasting time in a way. Then when it comes to your day job, you feel there is not enough time, you’re always running late, even when you don’t want to.</p
                <p>This week I worked on creating a website for one organisation, they haven’t asked me for it, its just that I need their help and would like to make life easier for others who may need a similar kind of help. Once I have built it, I will send it over to them to ask if they would be interested in the project.  Whilst building this website, I checked other similar organisations' websites and found this other section which I thought looked good, so tried to put it on my project, I got stuck in that hole for quite a while.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One thing I have come to realise is that when I get stuck, there’s always some bit of ego saying, ‘you’re smart, you should be able to figure that out without seeking external help’. That's not true! Well, it is true I may be smart, but seeking help doesn’t necessarily mean someone is not smart, it might actually indicate they work smart instead of working harder.<br>One time I was listening to the OneMonth podcast and they asked the guest, how much of coding is googling they said 70%. Googling is a significant part of the coding journey, so it is okay to google, it doesn’t mean you’re not smart enough. Even senior and experienced developers google things a lot.</p>
                <br>   
                <p>This is something not related to coding, rather about my day job, right! I am just saddened by the prevalence of cancer in this country, like everyday, new diagnosis is being made and some of these cancers are aggressive ones like pancreatic cancer which doesn’t have much prognosis really. When I brought this up to my colleague they tried offering some suggestions (to look on the bright side of life) because they thought I was just being pessimistic, I was not really looking for suggestions, I rather just wanted to vent out! It is a pity that Siri and Alexa don’t have the function to just listen and not provide suggestions, you know, maybe I should build a venting app!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I searched for local web developer meet up groups but, there doesn’t seem to be much, and their meeting times are like during the day time when I am at work! I am going to make an effort to visit one them, because I need a mentor.</p>

                <h2>Perfectionist Syndrome</h2>
                <p>18.07.2021</p>
                <p>I am meant to be writing a blog post each week, and sometimes I don’t do so for no good reason. Earlier on my journey I heard someone say that, one got to celebrate the wins, and as a way of doing so, I would say I am happy that I completed my tutorial hell immersion! <br>It started with a 12 hour coding bootcamp from Ania, then a 7 hour Javascript tutorial from FreeCodeCamp which was so good and comprehensive, I really enjoyed it and managed to do a simple blackjack game and a Chrome extension. From there I did an 8 hour tutorial with Qazi Rafeh of The Clever Programmer and it was also great, and more in depth, the blackjack game we built was so cool, it had asynchronous Javascript function. It is the one I have put under my projects list after minor styling.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>My plan was to do the rock, paper, scissors game, but then I thought, its just a simple game, the blackjack game I just did is more advanced, plus I really needed to get back into my course with ZTM. <br>What I keep hearing from those who taught themselves to code is that, you don’t necessarily need to fully know everything at the beginning, make sure you understand the fundamentals though. It has taken me a while to put this website online because I didn’t think it looked good enough to be shown to the world. I kept thinking, that I need to understand this particular concept first. And looking at the curriculum yesterday, I realised that I am running behind, I should really be learning about Javascript + NPM and building my site, but I still haven’t looked at things like Git and ES6-10. The course have those modules later. I know that I should be looking into finding the coding community to be part of, but I am still hesitant because I feel like I don’t know enough, like I am too beginner!</p> 
                <br>
                <p>One other advice I got yesterday was that, go on monk mode, where you cut down on things and people who don’t help with moving you forward in your journey. <br>Secondly, accept that this is my new normal,  sitting in front of a computer for 3+ hours a day; with time, the brain embraces that; by default our brains are lazy, always looking to find a path of least resistance.The other point is that, stick with the learning platform you are using, it is easy to get side tracked in search for more comprehensive teaching.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I guess the lesson from this week is that don’t wait to be perfect, because no one is perfect, you learn by doing along the way. The other big take away from yesterday, is that, reviewing things you have learnt is great. Things looked a bit more clearer and I said to myself, how did you not understand that? I don’t think I have reached my ahaa moment yet! See, there's that thing again, always feeling like I am not there yet. It is good thing to feel that way though, because if I ever feel like I know enough, then I would not push myself as hard as I do now.</p>
